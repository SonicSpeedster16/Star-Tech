COMMENTS:
This update is a bit lighter on mod updates and instead focuses on improving inter-mod compatibility and fixing issues. A lot of time has gone into reworking the CraftTweaker scripts to fix items from certain mods not working in machines from other mods, fix recipes that used unobtainable items, and make them more readable for future updates. The other big item in this release is the addition of LightningCraft to the pack.

CHANGES:
-Fixed the Atomic Battery recipe (now accepts any lead ingot).
-The Decontamination Unit now removes all radiation.
-Even more types of glass can be used with the Oxygen Sealer.
-Certain Galacticraft and More Planets ores are now usable in more Mekanism machines.
-Added Chisel variations to Astral Sorcery's Marble and some Twilight Forest items.
-BoP and Ice and Fire Sapphires can now be shapelessly converted to each other.
-Fixed tier of planets in More Planets mod.
-Hid Fronos blocks in JEI (planet is not implemented yet).
-Improved readability of Craftweaker scripts.

MODS:
Added:
-LightningCraft 2.9.1
Updated:
-Actually Additions (r148 > r149)

Star Tech 1.6.0  (07-04-2019)
-------------------------------------
COMMENTS:
This update downgrades several mods due to multiple crashes and performance issues in the more recent versions. Forge is also updated to the latest version for 1.12.2, and the CraftTweaker scripts have again been updated and cleaned up. Several space-related items that were previously uncraftable now have craftable recipes.

CHANGES:
-Updated Minecraft FORGE to 14.23.5.2838
-Fixed recipes for upgrading to the tier 4 Space Suit.
-Fixed several recipes for items and machines from Extra Planets (Electric Vehicles and Rockets are now obtainable!).
-Added smelting recipes for AE2 Certus Quartz Ore/Charged Certus Quartz Ore.
-Removed Extra Planets Uranium Armor and Tools (was uncraftable and low tier anyway).
-Restored default radiation settings.
-Added chocolate bars and caramel to the Ore Dictionary (should make chocolate bars and caramel from other mods compatible with Pam's HarvestCraft).
-Hid a few more unusable items in JEI.
-General script cleanup.

Star Tech 1.5.0  (06-22-2019)
-------------------------------------
COMMENTS:
Here's another update bringing a fair amount of changes. It's recommended to reset your mining dimensions due to a number of changes specifically affecting that dimension.

CHANGES:
-Void Ore Miners will now collect ores from Matter Overdrive.
-Void Resource Miners will now collect raw basalt, limestone and marble instead of chiseled versions.
-AE2 meteorites will now only generate in the Overworld.
-Ender IO magnets now work when in your main inventory and not just when in the hotbar or baubles slot.
-EnderStorage's ender chests now sound like vanilla ender chests instead of regular chests.
-The Scanner should now detect certus quartz and charged certus quartz ores.
-Disabled certus quartz and charged certus quartz world gen (is managed by CoFH World).
-Disabled generic death messages for named entities (stops mob farms from spamming the chat).
-Allowed flight in the Deep Dark.
-Lowered the total number of chunks a single chunk loader will keep loaded.
-Set the chunk loader time-out to 1 week (real time).
-Disabled AE2 items.csv generation.
-Increased world height of the Minig Dimension so that ores spawning higher in the world don't get missed during worldgen.
-Disabled oil generation in the Minig Dimension.
-Removed all Tesla Core Lib gear types (except diamond) from the registeredGearTypes option.
-Stop Just Enough Resources from profiling EVERY dimension (will hopefully help performance and lower memory use).
-Disabled WheelTweak in the Mouse Tweaks config (confilcted with Item Scroller).
-Made more kinds of glass work with Galacticraft's Oxygen Sealer.
-Regenerated a few configs.

MODS:
Added:
-Redstone Repository Revolved 1.4.0 (Because who doesn't like OP tools and armor?)

Star Tech 1.4.0  (06-09-2019)
-------------------------------------
COMMENTS:
This is a very large update to the pack that adds quite a few mods and contains a good number of config and script changes to help provide a bit more balance to the pack. A few mods have also been removed in order to help performance and keep the total number of mods closer to 200. 

While not required, I RECOMMEND a world restart due to the large number of changes to the pack in this update. If you choose not to restart your world, MAKE A FULL BACKUP and then you will need to RESET ALL GALACTICRAFT/SPACE DIMENSIONS (by deleting the relevant folders in your world folder). If you don't reset the space dimensions, you risk crashing when launching a rocket. 

CHANGES:
-Increased fuel consuption of rockets
-Tweaked dungeon boss difficulty on other planets/moons
-Lowered the amount of radiation reduced by anti-rad drinks (a decontamination unit is now the most effective way to reduce radiation)
-Added recipes to allow for upgrading of space suits to next tier
-Prevented Earth animals from spawning on Venus and other planets
-Disabled ability to fly in space dimensions (you'll have to use jetpacks instead!)
-Generate the Galacticraft dungeon locater as possible loot on Mars
-Prevented extra planet-specific ores from being collected by the Void Miner
-Enabled vanilla tree growth instead of big trees from Recurrent Complex (was causing lag issues with tree farms)
-Disabled AE2 Channels
-Enabled use of the older AE2 wireless Infinity Mechanic
-Hid more useless stuff in JEI
-Regenerated several configs

MODS:
Added:
-AE2 Stuff 0.7.0.4
